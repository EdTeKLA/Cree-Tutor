00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,360
On November 22, 2014

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,280
a burst of x-rays was detected by ASASSN

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,500
that's the All Sky Automated Survey for Super Novae

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,880
but this was no supernova

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,520
the signal came  from the center of a galaxy around 290 million light-years away

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,300
and what we now belive happened was a star came too close to a supermassive black hole

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,460
with a mass millions of times that of our Sun and it was eaten

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,960
The black hole fed on the star

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,080
and yes, this is the actual termenology astrophysicists use to describe it

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,400
Events like these are thought to be rare

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,560
occurring maybe once every 10,000 to 100,000 years in a galaxy

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,460
they're called Tidal Disruption Events, or Tidal Disruption Flares

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:49,460
as the star approached the side closest to the black hole experienced a much gravitational pull than the other side,

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,620
ripping the star to shreds

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,240
matter spiraling into the black hole formed an accretion disk

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,520
an annular ring of gas and dust

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,460
that's accelerating and heating up emitting visible light

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,380
UV and X-rays observable from Earth

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,080
Now what's remarkable about this event is that it transformed a dormant

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,580
or quiescent black hole

21
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,380
one that wasn't really feeding into one that we can observe

22
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,880
thanks to the matter falling in from that star

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,300
and is what it looked like

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,540
Okay if you're disappointed,

25
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,300
check out these artists renditions of the same event

26
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,960
but if you're cynical you might say

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,660
"Well how do we know that's what really happened?

28
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,360
what if the scientists are just making this up to get more grant funding

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,780
or to inspire people to go into science"

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,500
well I'll explain how we know this is actually what went down

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,020
but first things got wierder

32
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,960
scientists trained three X-ray telescopes to observe this part of the sky for years after the event

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,000
and what they found was a strong and regular pulse of X-rays

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,700
brightening and dimming every 131 seconds

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,740
and it shows up in the data from all three telescopes

36
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,520
they observed periodically over 450 days

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,580
but the pulse maintained this rhythm and didn't get weaker

38
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,120
in fact as time went on the relative strength of the pulse got stronger

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,160
modulating the X-ray signal by around 40%

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,980
and what was causing these periodic flashes of X-rays

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,740
and what could it tell us about the black hole

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,320
well let's back up

43
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,900
because black holes are some of the simplest objects in the Universe

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,920
by that I just mean that they are characterized by only two attributes

45
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,860
Mass and Spin

46
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,520
Okay, there's also charge

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,860
but since black holes should essentially be neutral mass and spin

48
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,200
are the two that count

49
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,640
mass is relatively easy to determine

50
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,180
far away from a black hole, you can even use Newtonian physics.

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,780
By measuring the gravitational effects of the black hole on other bodiesï¼Œ

52
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,180
you can estimate the mass of of the black hole

53
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,700
this has been done and black holes been found with masses ranging from

54
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,320
just few times our Sun, stellar-mass black holes,

55
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,240
up to billions of solar masses -- supermassive black holes

56
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,620
it's generally accepted that there is a supermassive black hole at the centers of most galaxies, including our own.

57
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,560
But what about spin?

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,440
since black holes form from collapsing stars and all known starts rotate,

59
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,160
all black holes should also be rotating

60
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,580
I mean, what are the chances that a bunch of matter just collapses into a point perfectly with no rotation?

61
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,580
It's just not going to happen.

62
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,560
And then additional matter falling into the black hole contributes its angular momentum.

63
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,960
So like a figure skater pulling their arms into a... point object,

64
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,980
You can imagine black holes get spinning pretty fast.

65
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,000
But spin is harder to measure because unlike mass, it only affects objects relatively close to the black hole.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,440
But there is a way to do it. Actually, 3 ways.

67
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,880
To understand all of them, you have to understand isco.

68
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,940
In Newtonian physics, around a compact mass,

69
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,240
you can place an object in a circular object at any radius and it will be stable.

70
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,320
It doesn't matter how close you get.

71
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,140
This is not the case according to general relativity.

72
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,120
Here, there is an innermost stable circular orbit,

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,900
With a radius know as r-isco.

74
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,240
Closer than this, and no orbits are stable: they all fall into the black hole.

75
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,840
So when you're looking at a black hole that is feeding, the innermost edge of the accretion disk is at r-isco.

76
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,320
What's useful for our purposes is that r-isco depends on the spin of the black hole.

77
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,140
The faster it's spinning, the smaller r-isco becomes.

78
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,840
Assuming it's spinning in the same direction as the matter in the accretion disk.

79
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,900
The rotation enables particles to orbit closer to the black hole,

80
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,520
than they'd be able to for a non-spinning black hole.

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,580
So you can kind of think of it as though the spin is supporting the particles against the relentless pull of gravity.

82
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,420
Now spin is normally discussed in terms of a dimensionless parameter

83
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,080
that ranges from 0, no spin, to 1, maximum spin.

84
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:56,520
Though I guess you could also have spins down to -1 if the black hole is spinning in the opposite direction from the accretion disk.

85
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,240
Now, as spin increases, r-isco decreases.

86
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,540
by a factor of 6, shrinking down to the size of the event horizon.

87
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,740
And this sets what many scientists think is the maximum spin a black hole can have.

88
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,860
Because if the minimum stable orbit were the size of the event horizon,

89
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,440
Then light could escape from the black hole, allowing us to see into the singularity.

90
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,940
This is called a naked singularity, and it makes a lot of scientists uncomfortable.

91
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,940
As yet, there isn't a strong theoretical reason why a black hole can't exceed this maximum spin,

92
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,680
It's just that we haven't seen one, and the thought of an exposed singularity just kind of... feels wrong.

93
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,660
Most suspect the maximum real-world spin parameter is around 0.998.

94
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,260
So how can you use r-isco to measure the spin of a black hole?

95
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:48,580
Well first, let's think of how we measure the size of anything far away from us in deep space, like the radius of a star

96
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,960
Most stars are so far away that they're simply point objects in our telescopes.

97
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,660
So how can you figure out their radii?

98
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,180
Well, first, look at the spectrum of their light.

99
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,020
By seeing how red-shifted absorption lines are, you can determine how far away the star is.

100
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,700
The spectrum also tells you the temperature of the star --

101
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,960
Because it should approximate a black-body curve.

102
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,860
And now the power radiated per unit area is strongly dependent on its temperature.

103
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,700
So if you know how bright the star appears from Earth,

104
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,700
how far away it is, and how much power its radiating per unit area,

105
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,820
Well, then you could work out its area and hence its radius.

106
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,460
You can actually so something very similar for a black hole's accretion disk.

107
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,080
Just instead of estimating the radius of a glowing sphere,

108
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,240
you're estimating the radius of the dark circle, r-isco, in the middle of the glowing accretion disk.

109
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,160
Then you can use r-isco to find the spin parameter.

110
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,840
This has been done for a number of black holes, revealing spin parameters from around 0.1 up to close to the maximum.

111
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,400
But this method only works if the radiation from the black hole is dominated by black-body radiation from the accretion disk.

112
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,140
which, often, it's not.

113
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,050
Another approach involves looking at x-rays emitted by iron around a black hole.

114
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,280
Some black holes show a distinct iron emission line.

115
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,650
But instead of the single frequency you'd expect,

116
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,280
the line is broadened by factors like the Doppler shift due to the high velocity of the iron in the accretion disk.

117
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,310
and gravitational redshift, due to the extreme gravitational fields close to the black hole.

118
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,310
By looking at the low-energy limit of the iron emission line,

119
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,820
you can determine how close the black hole it was emitted.

120
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,370
And hence, r-isco.

121
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,020
But what if there is no bright iron emission line?

122
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,170
Well, luckily, there is a third way.

123
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,710
And that, is to look for periodic oscillations in the data.

124
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,600
Like the repeated x-rays observed every 131 seconds.

125
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,770
The thinking is, these cycles must be caused by clumps of matter orbiting the black hole.

126
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,880
And at frequencies that high, they must be orbiting very close in, probably near r-isco.

127
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,710
Even that close, they'd be going half the speed of light.

128
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,820
But what kind of clumps or objects would these be?

129
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,570
Well the study's authors argue that the best candidate involves an unlikely scenario:

130
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:01,910
Years before the tidal disruption event, they propose that there was a white dwarf start in orbit around this black hole.

131
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,280
Now, it might be stable, orbiting in this way, for perhaps one or two hundred years.

132
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,020
By itself it wouldn't be visible from Earth.

133
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,850
But then the other star wondered by, and was ripped apart in the tidal disruption event.

134
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,310
Its mass fell in towards the black hole forming an accretion disk.

135
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,020
With the addition of this stellar debris, the white dwarf was cloaked in glowing matter,

136
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:28,680
creating an x-ray hotspot orbiting the black hole, and its period would directly relate to the spin of the black hole.

137
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:36,020
In this case, the measured spin parameter turned out to be at least 0.7 and possibly as high as the theoretical maximum of 0.998,

138
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,880
meaning objects in the accretion disk were going at least half the speed of light.

139
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:45,020
This is the first measurement of spin made possible by a tidal disruption event.

140
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,480
The implication is that this could provide a method for determining the spin of black holes.

141
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,020
Particularly ones that have been dormant, which is about 95% of supermassive black holes.

142
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,450
If they shred a star, we get insight into their spin.

143
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,910
Now why is this important? Well, because it helps us understand the origins of black holes.

144
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:11,710
If supermassive black holes grow in size mainly by feeding on a steady stream of matter from within their own galaxy,

145
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:17,600
You'd expect their spins to be very large, because the angular momentum of that matter would be more or less aligned.

146
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
so it would add up over time.

147
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,970
But if instead, supermassive black holes grow predominantly by merging with other black holes,

148
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,710
You might expect their spins to be lower, because the spins of two black holes are likely to be randomly oriented rather than aligned.

149
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,420
As we are able to measure the spins of more black holes in different ways, farther out and therefore further back in time,

150
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,000
We should be able to better understand their growth.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,820
And since supermassive black holes lie at the center of most galaxies,

152
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:52,080
They also lie at the center of an understanding of how those galaxies have formed and evolved over billions of years.
