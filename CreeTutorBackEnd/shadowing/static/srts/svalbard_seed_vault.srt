1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,020
So this is like the world's most important freezer?

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,560
It is. Really. *laughs*

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,060
The most important room in the world, someone has said.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,040
These are pretty big claims for a place located

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,900
just 1300 km, or 800 miles

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,260
from the north pole.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,400
But then, this is no ordinary place.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,440
It's the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,800
Well, actually, this is just it's front door.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Inside the seed vault are a series of tunnels.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,780
It's not actually that cold right here, but

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,900
as we go deeper, it is only going to get colder.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,580
This is Bente

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,620
You're an engineer, Bente?

15
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,120
Yes, I am

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,540
Are you gonna show us where to go?

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,220
*chuckles* Yeah

18
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:44,940
Fantastic

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
How many doors are there?

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,460
One, two, three, four, five doors

21
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,020
until we are into the secret room.

22
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,940
Five doors to the secret room

23
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,900
Woah.

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,920
That's what I'm talking about.

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,000
These are the lenghts of tunnel that take you down

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,120
into the seed vault.

27
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,140
This facility was built to last around 200 years

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,880
and withstand earthquakes and explosions.

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,820
It was placed on the side of a mountain

30
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,800
so even if all the ice on earth melts

31
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,740
it will still be above sea level.

32
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,540
There are three separate vault rooms where seeds are stored

33
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,660
but only one of them is in use right now.

34
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,440
And it's buried over 120 meters from the front door.

35
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,000
The whole point of putting the vaults so deep in this mountain

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,560
is to put it within permafrost.

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,180
So, all around me, the earth naturally stays

38
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,480
around -4 or -5 all year round.

39
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,800
And, that way, if something did happen

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,400
and the cooling stopped flowing here, there was no power.

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,200
Then, well, behind these doors

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,880
it would still remain probably, you know,

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,120
-4 or -5 Celsius, forever.

44
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,340
Assuming, of course, global temperatures don't rise that much.

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,640
This place is sometimes called "The Doomsday Vault",

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,660
because even in a worst case scenario

47
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,820
it should preserve the diversity of the world's food crops.

48
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,060
Now we are really in the mountain.

49
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,900
Surrounded by permafrost.

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,040
And, here's a cross tunnel

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,280
that leads to three vault doors.

52
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,440
Vault number 1 is up there

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,720
Vault number 2,

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,080
and this is the one that is actually being used.

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,860
And then, vault number 3.

56
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,500
It's pretty amazing to look up and see

57
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,480
ice covered ceilings and walls everywhere.

58
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,960
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault works essentially like a bank vault?

59
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,720
Yes, it's almost, yeah, because

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,140
the seeds lay in the boxes like this.

61
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,860
These boxes are sealed when they come to Svalbard.

62
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,000
And none of us can open it

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,120
We put it through the security system at the airports

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,980
just to check that it isn't any explosives or anything in it.

65
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,580
But it works like a bank box.

66
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,100
We can't open this.

67
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,360
Only the depositor can open and take out their seeds

68
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,100
So you don't open any of the seeds, any of the boxes that come here?

69
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,680
No.

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,640
Well. How do you know that people are really deposing the seeds,

71
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,360
like barely they say they are not, and other things?

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,640
Just because they have signed the contract. That's it.

73
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,500
We can't be sure about it. Of course, we trust them.

74
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,220
Would there be seeds for some crops that

75
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,980
people might consider illicit, like marijuana

76
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,340
That is said that that shall not be in here.

77
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,940
No drugs and also no gene-modified material

78
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,260
No genetically modified seeds go in here?

79
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,200
Yeah, Norway has asked for that no genetical material is kept in here.

80
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,160
Are there any particularity strange crops?

81
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,140
Has anyone deposited anything that is really odd or weird?

82
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,380
Ahhh.. No, nothing weird is in here,

83
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:58,920
but we get some questions from people that wants to put in their own private seeds.

84
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:06,220
I've also has had letters from men wanting to put their gene material in here.

85
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,040
That is really strange and we don't answer those.

86
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:16,680
This is the door to the vault and behind here, there are nearly a million different varieties of seeds,

87
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,020
from all over the world,

88
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,120
kept at minus 18 degrees Celsius.

89
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,040
You know how I can tell that it's minus 18Â°C in here?

90
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,460
You can actually feel the moisture in your nose freeze so,

91
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,560
Your nostrils get all stiff...

92
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,760
Yeah,

93
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,920
And I see behind you we have some Canadian seeds,

94
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,120
which is exciting for me because I am Canadian.

95
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,940
So what sort of things do we have... From Canada,

96
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,140
I'm really not... Not sure because... This box... On the outside doesn't tell what's in it,

97
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,460
but,

98
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:57,360
These numbers here are connected to a database on the internet so you can go in there afterwards.

99
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Derek: There you go.  Bente: Yeah

100
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,400
You can go find out what has Canada got stored in the Seed Vault.

101
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,220
What are we looking at right here.

102
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,800
It's like a bank vault except everything that you've put in there is publicly available.

103
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,900
Yeah, it is. (chuckles)

104
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,060
These are the coolest boxes I think. They are from North Korea.

105
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,340
Derek: Oh my goodness!                                                                         Bente: Wooden hand made boxes

106
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,460
Derek: They look like they come from the 1960s or something. Do you think?

107
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,960
Bente: Yeah, they do.

108
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Derek: They built them specially.

109
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,600
Bente: They built them specially because they got the measurements of how big should the boxes be

110
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,800
and these are built exactly of those measurements.

111
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,400
And here you see that North Korea is placed on the same shelf as USA, it's just on the back there.

112
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,160
It's on the back side.

113
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,020
And you have South Korea, just on the back.

114
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,520
So here there are like in a small United Nations, deep in the mountains of Svalbard.

115
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
(Chuckles)

116
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,600
So these are the last few bare shelves in Vault 2.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,040
Once the other two vaults are full, there will be around 3 million different species of plants stored here

118
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,620
with over 500 seeds per sample.

119
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,960
So one day, there may be over a billion seeds stored inside this mountain,

120
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,640
representing the vast majority of Earth's agricultural diversity.

121
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:19,520
And you don't know today what kind of seeds that you can grow in 20, 30, 40 years from now,

122
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,720
because of the climate change.

123
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,840
Perhaps you have to use another type of seed

124
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:32,320
thirty years from now that can handle warmer climate, dryer climate, wetter climate,

125
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
whatever is going to happen.

126
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,020
So that is why it's so important to have a backup of all the seeds

127
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,160
so that you are sure that you can also grow the food we need,

128
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,160
for the next generations to come.

129
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,120
But this isn't the only seed bank on Earth.

130
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,580
There are around 1700 other gene banks around the world,

131
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,560
run by different countries and organizations.

132
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,420
And, at a cost of $9 million to build the Svalbard seed vault

133
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,700
and millions more to run it,

134
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,880
it's worth asking whether this is a costly redundancy, or a valuable insurance policy.

135
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,080
And perhaps, the best people to answer this question are the Syrians, who, last year, were the first

136
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
to make a withdrawal from the seed vault.

137
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,920
The gene bank in Aleppo, in Syria, is now out of order, it's been bombed.

138
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:25,220
So one third of the material that is kept in here is now taken down to Morocco and Lebanon.

139
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,400
And this is some of the material that now has been returned, so to get the material going again.

140
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
So that's why it's empty.

141
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,820
Will those seeds actually be used to grow crops?

142
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,620
Yeah, they will. Yeah.

143
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,880
Over the last 13 thousand years we have cultivated millions of species of plants.

144
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,340
The agricultural revolution underpinned the technological and population explosions

145
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,860
that made our modern lives possible.

146
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,100
The risk of a real Doomsday scenario is incredibly remote.

147
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,340
But, whatever happens, thanks to this outpost at the top of the world

148
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,980
at least our seeds are safe.

149
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,620
Hey, I'm currently on a train traveling from Washington, D.C. to New York City so I can't talk to loud.

150
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:18,700
And actually after Norway, I went to Seoul, South Korea, Los Angeles, Boston , New York and Washington,

151
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,940
so it's been some crazy travels for me.

152
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,980
And on all these travels I've been listening to audio books from Audible

153
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,300
who also support Veritasium which I am very thankful for.

154
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,000
If you didn't know already, Audible has like 250,000 titles in all areas of literature,

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,540
including fiction, non-fiction and periodicals.

156
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,320
And if you go to Audible.com/veritasium you can get a 30 day free trial of the website

157
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
where you can just try out listening to a book.

158
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,300
So if you are at all interested in listening to audio books, I highly recommend you check them out.

159
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,120
And there is a book I can recommend to you, it is my favorite fiction book of all time.

160
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,400
It's called "Everything is Illuminated" by Jonathon Safran Foer.

161
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:00,280
It is-  I don't know, its just such a complex interwoven novel, you have to

162
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,160
read it or listen to it to know what i mean.

163
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,120
But you can check it out. You can download that book for free for a one month trial

164
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
or you can pick any other book of your choosing.

165
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,400
So, I really want to thank Audible for supporting me and helping me go to all these amazing places.

166
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,660
And I want to thank you for watching.
