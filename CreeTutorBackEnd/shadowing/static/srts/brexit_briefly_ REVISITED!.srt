1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,900
Hey, what's going on with Brexit?

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Well, there sure has been a lot of political squabbling here at ground level.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's...

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
...float away from all that for a look at the big picture.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,720
Up here it's easier to see the one-two-three

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,840
of the impossible Trinity.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,880
But first, quick British Isles primer:

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,640
The United Kingdom contains England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,240
This last part of the United Kingdom shares

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,580
the island of Ireland with the country of Ireland.

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,800
This Ireland is in the European Union and 
 the United Kingdom is...

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,660
Well, that's the whole thing, isn't it?

13
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,000
Before UK voted to Brexit,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the European Union wall encircled them all.

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,640
(The wall isn't literal, it's a metaphor for

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,060
the overlapping circles of EU institutions

17
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,060
and border complications impossible to draw, so...)

18
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,640
It's a metaphor wall.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,620
Maximum Brexit is the exit where UK leaves

20
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,780
to build her own wall separate from the EU

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,600
and be like any other country.

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,480
This maximum Brexit is the top of the Trinity,

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,780
with a wall around the UK,

24
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,220
which, following the border,

25
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,080
would go straight across the Irish island.

26
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,860
Hahâ€”Oh, oh no...

27
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,040
The books on Ireland, Northern Ireland's and the UK's

28
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,440
long and complicated (and sometimes frightening) relationship

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,320
are not tomes to be opened here.

30
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,160
The much shorter and safer version is

31
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,940
there used to be a wall between the Irelands

32
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,180
but there was a lot of the violence and a lot of the troubles

33
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,560
until on a very good Friday

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,660
Ireland and the UK agreed there would never be a wall between them again,

35
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,380
full stop.

36
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,540
This, while it didn't uncomplicate the relationship,

37
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,960
at least made it nonviolent.

38
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,780
A new wall plowing between them

39
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,960
would break this vital political promise,

40
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,740
thus UK and Ireland and even EU all agree:

41
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,040
a wall here is super no bueno.

42
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,420
No wall across Ireland is the second vertex of the impossible Trinity.

43
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,840
Wait, why do we need a wall anyway?

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,400
Oh, right: the maximum Brexit creates a land border with the EU.

45
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,580
because UK is an island unto herself mostly,

46
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,580
but not completely.

47
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,260
So if UK says this is unacceptable

48
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,840
and all agree *this* is unacceptable,

49
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,260
then the wall could go...

50
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,340
here, maybe?

51
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,880
Ah, compromise!

52
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
UK tries to march out of the EU

53
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,380
but not everybody makes it.

54
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,300
Northern Ireland stays in the EU (sort of?)

55
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,100
on the other side of the wall while still being part of the UK,

56
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,900
while the EU whispers into her ear

57
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,920
that were she to let go and unite with Ireland,

58
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,080
that's cool with EU.

59
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,020
Ain't no thing, girl.

60
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,400
Poor Northern Ireland.

61
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,380
She's on Ireland,

62
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,060
but mostly thinks of herself as British,

63
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,240
but also Irish,

64
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,060
but could end up being the last part of the UK in the EU,

65
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,240
while also having the right to leave the UK

66
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,680
and join Ireland if she ever votes to.

67
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,440
For UK,

68
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,480
this situation means a wall inside the United Kingdom.

69
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,500
No nation wants to create an external wall through internal territory.

70
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Thus, the final vertex of the Trinity:

71
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,460
No walls inside the UK.

72
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,700
Leaving Northern Ireland behind while staying connected to her

73
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,760
also means some of those overlapping EU institutions

74
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,220
can pass through the wall,

75
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,060
making Britain's Brexit rather less than maximum.

76
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,100
Aaand political geography being what it is,

77
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,320
that's it for options!

78
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,500
This, this or this,

79
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,440
all of which the UK refuses.

80
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,480
But you wanted the wall in a different place!

81
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,360
That was like, your whole thing!

82
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
None of these are acceptable.

83
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,440
Thus the impossible Trinity where the UK must pick a side.

84
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,460
Promising no walls means no maximum Brexit,

85
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,160
promising maximum Brexit means

86
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,120
there's got to be a wall somewhere,

87
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,900
and so, for a long time,

88
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,940
nothing of consequence happened.

89
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,820
Can...

90
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,260
...you pick now?

91
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,780
(sips tea)

92
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,040
What if I put the wall...

93
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,080
...here?

94
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,940
But only temporarily.

95
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,680
That doesn't solve anything!

96
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,200
That just kicks the Northern Ireland down the road

97
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,560
until we're right back where we started!

98
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,120
So that's what's been going on with Brexit.

99
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,800
There's nothing as permanent as a temporary solution

100
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,700
and ultimately, there's no avoiding the Trinity.

101
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,240
There's three things...

102
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,260
...pick two.

103

[Music]

104
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,400
You can go now.
