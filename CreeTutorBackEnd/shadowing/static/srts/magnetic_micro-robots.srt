1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,580
These are magnetic microrobots,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,860
just
millimeters in size.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,480
They bend and move in response to applied magnetic fields

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,800
And with these magnetic fields
controlled by a gaming controller the

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,100
micro robots can be driven carefully and
precisely.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,260
They can turn by changing the

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,820
direction of the magnetic field.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,560
Roll in a rotating field

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,660
And even grasp and jump

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,240
It often feels like you're playing a
video game.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,360
In some previous work I did

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,190
as a demonstration I was pushing blocks
of material around and using a micro robot

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,280
like a bulldozer.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,060
And the demonstration I
did was playing Tetris.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,780
The idea is this technique could be used
to assemble human organ tissues by

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,820
arranging blocks of different types of
cells in particular patterns.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,360
The way these scientists actually fabricate the
micro robots is pretty ingenious.

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,700
Tiny rare earth magnets are magnetized in a
strong magnetic field.

19
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,980
Then they're mixed into a UV resin that will harden when
exposed to UV light.

20
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:35,360
The mixture is poured into a mold and placed on a stage
below which is a rotatable permanent magnet.

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,720
This creates an adjustable
magnetic field to which all the tiny

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,220
magnets in the resin align.

23
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,070
When the
desired orientation is reached UV light

24
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,220
cures the resin in one particular spot
locking those magnets in place.

25
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,180
Then the magnetic field can be adjusted and the
next section cured.

26
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,020
Ultimately the result is a flexible device with imbedded
magnets that have different orientations

27
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,860
depending on where they are.

28
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,960
This pattern of orientations is what

29
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,820
gives these micro robots their unique
behavior in response to magnetic fields.

30
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,380
If we can point multiple compass needles in opposite directions within a flexible
device,

31
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,079
if we apply the field vertically

32
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,200
those compass needles will both try to
orient and align with that applied field.

33
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,840
With the right magnetic fields the results can be pretty
sophisticated.

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,060
Watch this micro robot

35
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,040
pick up a block

36
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,300
and then roll with it over to a ramp.

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,460
It rolls up the ramp,

38
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,440
deposits the block at the top,

39
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,580
and then
returns to its original position.

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,020
The idea is that devices like this could be
used in medical applications.

41
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,920
So this could be sending a device into fluid
areas in your body or into your

42
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,060
gastrointestinal tract. For example a
capsule that you could swallow which

43
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,380
will go passively through your GI tract,
have no wires attached and at the right

44
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,540
moment we can activate a sampling
chamber basically to open up and take

45
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,480
samples of either stomach or small
intestine contents, take biopsy samples

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,900
of the intestinal wall.

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,830
But grippers like
these may not be the only magnetic

48
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,200
microrobots invading your body.

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,459
A different research group has pioneered

50
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,480
these even smaller peanut-shaped
magnetic particles.

51
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,320
And under the right magnetic field conditions they form
swarms.

52
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,920
This warm can take on different

53
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,720
configurations: the vortex, where many
particles travel together like a school of fish,

54
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,560
the chain, where particles line
up and travel single-file.

55
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,320
And the ribbon, where motion is perpendicular to the
line of particles.

56
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,866
One potential application of micro robotic swarms is
drug delivery.

57
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:49,359
Each magnetic particle

58
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,920
could carry a small amount of drug and
be guided toward the intended drug delivery site.

59
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,459
So to make a swarm useful
for essential biomedical applications, you'd

60
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,380
like to keep the swarm aggregated.

61
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,680
You probably will not be able to see single

62
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,760
micrometer sized particles but you could
see the entire swarm.

63
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,980
So you'd like to keep it aggregated so you can move it
and keep track.

64
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,740
But then going through

65
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,900
tight environments, for example going
through blood vessels

66
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,360
if your swarm, the overall swarm size is bigger than the
blood vessel then it doesn't fit so you

67
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,199
need to line them up and squeeze through
so that's the motivation for being able

68
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
to control the shape of the swarm.

69
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,580
And, who knows, one day you might have swarms

70
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,320
of magnetic microrobots cleaning your
teeth.

71
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,060
another group of researchers has used
tiny magnetic robots to clear biofilms -

72
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,060
those are communities of bacteria and
the protective sugar polymers around them.

73
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,680
They typically build up on medical
devices, the insides of pipes, and on teeth.

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,120
Can I ask, does this idea of
magnetic control of micro robots, does it

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,400
supplant previous concepts?

76
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,000
Like I'm trying to conceptualize this in terms of

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,889
like you know sci-fi futures with
nanobots where I imagine you know we

78
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,250
imagine these things as really
self-contained and you know powering

79
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,320
themselves around the body and that sort
of stuff.

80
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,479
Yeah, great question. So the advantage of
magnetic fields is that it's a very

81
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,949
scalable technique. So we can make
magnetic microbots that are single cell

82
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:26,320
size and we can make them that are
centimeters in size and the principles

83
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,740
behave similarly.

84
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,340
It pulls off a lot of
the functionality to

85
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,960
off-board magnetic coils. We can have a big
computer sitting there and power supply

86
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,840
It's a lot of the hard aspects of
driving a robot we can do as

87
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,440
traditional size. You can have a big computer

88
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,190
We can have medical imaging hooked up

89
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,000
and do all these things off board and
then on board we're just transmitting

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,680
the magnetic field directly to the
device and so this our micro robot is

91
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,180
basically then just like the mechanical
hand of the robot and the rest of the

92
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,300
robot is really sitting on the table
beside the patient.

93
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,460

veritasium that's V E R I T A S I U M

99
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,340
to 500 500. Now if you're looking for
something good to listen to might I

100
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,390
recommend "How to Change Your Mind: What
the new science of psychedelics teaches

101
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:41,130
us about consciousness dying, addiction
depression and transcendence by Michael

102
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,169
Pollan. This is a fascinating book and
it's narrated by the author himself. I'm

103
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,710
actually listening to it at the moment
and he may be changing my mind about the

104
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:55,229
very nature of consciousness. What I find
so incredible is how recent this

105
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:59,620
scientific field is and what it's
revealing about how all of our brains work.

106
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,300
Now when I'm listening to books
like this I actually look forward to

107
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,729
getting stuck in traffic.
I find it reduces my stress levels

108
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,810
because I'm learning something rather
than just wasting time in the car.

109
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,350
Now the way it works with Audible is that as
a member you can choose three titles
