What do I have to push, sub-basement?
>>Woman: Sub-basement.

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[Buzzing safety alarm]

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,960
I'm at the National Institute of Standards & Technology
in Washington D.C.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,120
and I'm going to the sub-basement.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,220
It's getting dark down here.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,800
We're going to find out how they're going to
redefine a kilogram.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,980
The kilogram is in trouble.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,520
Since 1799, it's been defined as
the mass of a metal cylinder,

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,760
in a locked vault
in a basement in Paris.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,000
But over the last century, careful measurements
of this international prototype kilogram

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,320
and in-theory-identical national standards
from around the world,

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,840
have shown that their masses are diverging.

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,900
The spread has grown to around
50 micrograms, or 50 parts per billion.

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,200
And having a standard of mass that changes
is unacceptable.

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,700
Plus, the kilogram is the last of the base SI units
to still be defined by a physical object.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,920
The metre, for example, used to be defined
as the length of a platinum bar in Paris,

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,540
but in 1983 it was redefined
as the distance light travels

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,840
in 1/299,792,458 of a second.

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:11,440
This definition means that the speed of light
is set to exactly 299,792,458

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,440
point 00000...

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,300
et cetera, metres per second.

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,140
Note how this works:
first, you take the existing definition,

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,020
say, the length of that metre bar,

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,700
and you measure as carefully as you can
how it relates to a physical constant of the universe:

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,880
the speed of light.

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,140
Then you set the exact value of that constant

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,640
and use *it* to redefine how long a metre is.

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,280
I know this might seem circular,
but, importantly, it moves the point of truth

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,540
off of the physical object,
and onto the unchanging constant of the universe.

30
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,100
So, naturally, the thought is
to do the same thing with the kilogram.

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,960
But... using which constant, and how?

32
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,060
[Heavy mechanical noises]

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,760
Well, there are a number of
different strategies that were attempted

34
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,280
but the two that achieved
the greatest success were:

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,300
1) using a silicon sphere to determine and set
Avogadro's number

36
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,340
and 2) to use a Watt balance
to determine and set Planck's constant.

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,360
>>DEREK: Hi, how ya' doin'? I'm Derek.
>>JON: Pretty good.
>>DEREK: Nice to meet you.

38
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,740
>>DEREK: Where is the Watt balance?

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,300
>>STEPHAN: The Watt balance is
behind these closed doors, and...

40
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,340
>>DEREK: It's in there?

41
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,140
>>STEPHAN: It's correct,
and right now the problem is that...

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,480
We are in a crunch to get a number
by the end of May.

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,640
>>DEREK: What's the number?

44
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,940
>>STEPHAN: The Planck's constant.
This is what we measure with the Watt balance.

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,940
In 2011,
the General Conference on Weights and Measures

46
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,280
decided that the kilogram should be redefined
based on Planck's constant,

47
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,420
but that doesn't mean that
the Avogadro approach was futile.

48
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,700
I mean, you can use Avogadro's number
to calculate Planck's constant and vice-versa.

49
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,020
So, ultimately, both approaches
are going to be used to redefine

50
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,180
Planck's constant and
Avogadro's number simultaneously.

51
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,480
>>STEPHAN: One good thing about
having silicon spheres,

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,840
is that you only want to redefine if you have
agreement between different numbers, right?

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,500
And the silicon sphere method is a method
in my mind that comes out of chemistry.

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,040
You measure Avogadro's constant, which is
a constant that comes out of chemistry.

55
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,560
This method comes out of physics,
we measure Planck's constant.

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,480
So if they both agree, it's a pretty strong sign, right?
Because you know chemistry and physics agree.

57
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,780
Now, since I've already discussed the
Avogadro approach in a previous video,

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,080
here I want to focus on the Watt balance.

59
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,760
It's actually now called a Kibble balance
in honor of its inventor, Bryan Kibble,

60
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,860
who actually passed away in 2016.

61
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,280
You know, traditional balances work by equating
the gravitational forces on objects in two pans.

62
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,460
The Kibble balance looks kind of similar,
but all of the balancing happens on the left-hand side,

63
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,780
where a mass pan is attached
to a coil of wire in a magnetic field.

64
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,300
On the right-hand side is a motor.

65
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,820
The whole apparatus is sealed
and operated in vacuum.

66
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
The balance operates in two modes:

67
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,520
Weighing mode and velocity mode,

68
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,800
and both are required
to determine Planck's constant.

69
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,220
In weighing mode, a kilogram mass standard
is placed on the mass pan

70
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,980
and then current is passed
through the coil in the magnetic field

71
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,260
and adjusted until the weight of
the kilogram is equal and opposite

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,320
to the electromagnetic
force on the coil.

73
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,500
The equation for this is
Mass times the local gravitational acceleration

74
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,960
is equal to the Magnetic field, times the length of wire in the coil, times the current flowing through it

75
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:17,040
In this equation the variables that are difficult to measure exactly are the magnetic field strength, and the length of wire in the coil

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,600
But luckily the Kibble balance allows us to get around this problem using velocity mode

77
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:28,500
In velocity mode the kilogram mass is lifted off the mass pan and now the motor on the other side of the balance is used to

78
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,240
Move the coil back and forth at constant velocity through the magnetic field.

79
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,060
This motion induces a voltage in the coil which is equal to the magnetic field,

80
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,080
times the length of wire in the coil, times its velocity.

81
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,840
Now we have two equations which we can solve for B times L and so we can set them equal to each other and

82
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,980
eliminate these variables without having to know precisely what their values are

83
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,940
and if we rearrange a little bit you get voltage times current equals mass times gravity times velocity.

84
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,900
on the left hand side, there is electrical power and on the right hand side, mechanical power,

85
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,120
and that's why this was called the Watt, the unit of power, balance

86
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:11,600
But how do you go from this to Planck's constant the number that relates a photon's frequency to its energy?

87
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:19,760
Well it turns out there's actually a way of measuring voltage accurately using a macroscopic quantum effect that involves Josephson junctions

88
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,100
so a Josephson junction consists of two superconductors separated by a thin piece of insulator

89
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:34,720
Now if you apply a microwave radiation to that junction, you create a voltage across the device and its value is precisely known to be

90
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:42,360
hf over 2 e. Where h is Planck's constant, f is the frequency of the radiation, and e is the charge on an electron

91
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,860
Now by tuning that frequency and stacking as many of these Josephson junctions as you want in series

92
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,820
you can create virtually any voltage you like very very precisely.

93
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,820
The way this is used in the Kibble balance is a stack of hundreds of thousands of Josephson junctions

94
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,600
are put into the circuit with the coil as it is moved through the field

95
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,060
and so you exactly balance the voltage which is induced in the coil using those Josephson junctions

96
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,920
So you can measure that voltage very very accurately.

97
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,680
But how do we measure current?

98
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,240
Well it turns out this voltage measuring method is so good that instead of trying to measure current directly

99
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,860
we instead measure V on R which is the same thing

100
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,860
So this current is passed through a resistor, and we measure that voltage again using Josephson junctions

101
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,140
And then to measure resistance we use another macroscopic quantum effect called the quantum hall effect.

102
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,480
Which is Beyond the scope of this video but,

103
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,420
suffice is to say that the resistance measurement will be an integer fraction, one over p

104
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,000
times Planck's constant divided by the charge on the Electron squared

105
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,600
So if we sub all of this into our equation and solve for h, we have that Planck's constant is equal to four

106
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,480
over p n squared, those are all constant numbers that we know, times the local acceleration due to gravity times velocity

107
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,660
divided by frequency squared times the mass which is one kilogram.

108
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:06,480
So here we have a very precise equation for Planck's constant in terms of the mass of one kilogram

109
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,280
Now to get an answer that's good to say, ten parts per billion

110
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,960
You need to know all of these values very accurately

111
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,680
So to measure V for example the velocity of the coil as it moves through the Magnetic field,

112
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,780
we use a laser interferometer

113
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,160
as the distance to the coil changes the interference Fringes pass over a detector

114
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,080
And essentially by counting how many fringes go past in a certain period of time

115
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,900
you can determine the speed of the coil very accurately

116
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,040
To measure g, a device called a gravimeter was used

117
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,960
to map out the local acceleration due to gravity in the balance room before it was built in there

118
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,000
The gravimeter actually drops a corner reflector down a vacuum tube and measures its acceleration

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,600
again through interferometry, counting the fringes as they pass

120
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,400
This is a 3D printed map of the acceleration due to gravity in the Kibble balance room

121
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,220
The bump is due to the mass of the powerful and very heavy permanent magnet that's in the balance

122
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,820
The acceleration due to gravity must continually be measured because it can be affected at this level of precision

123
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,860
By the positions of the sun and moon and even the water table underneath the building

124
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,460
In 2018 the kilogram will no longer be defined by an object in Paris

125
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,220
Instead it will be defined based on the fixed value of Planck's constant

126
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,440
which is being finalized right now as a result of all these measurements from the Kibble balances and silicon spheres

127
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,820
So right now what we do is, we put the mass in, and we get h out

128
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,600
and in 2018, after redefinition, h will be fixed and you use that to realize the unit of mass

129
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,840
