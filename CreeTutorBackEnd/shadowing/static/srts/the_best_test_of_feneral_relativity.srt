1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,460
Okay...

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,440
Hello. Hey.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,820
So, this is good, this is good. You - you're working, can you see me?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,540
I can see you.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,940
Do you know what went wrong in-uh.. during the launch..?

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,680
Yes - it's not complicated, but, it's a long chain of events..

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,660
On august, 21., 2014, two satellites were launched by the European Space Agency.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,000
They're called Galileo Satellites 5 and 6.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,560
They were intended to become part of the Global Navigation Satellite System, or GNSS.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,340
This is the European version of the American GPS systems.

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:36,840
 

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,780
Now, after successfully blasting off into space,

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,340
The satellites were launched with the Russian 5-6 rockets;

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:54,440
The final stage of the rocket was set to inject the satellites into circular orbit around 23000 kilometers above the Earth.

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,380
But that - - is when something went wrong

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,240
Uhh. there was thermal breach between a line of cold helium, and a line of propellant.

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,820
So, the propellant, it froze;

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,720
This caused the failure of the altitude control thrusters.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,160
The satellites seemed to have been injected into some random direction.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,960
It was launched, but in the wrong direction.

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,920
This sent the satellites into highly elliptical, and seemingly useless orbits.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,940
At their low point, the satellites didn't really get a full view of earth..

23
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,880
Earth sensors, which enabled them to orient their navigation antennas - stopped working,

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,180
because the earth just filled their field of view.

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,560
At the other extreme, the satellites went too high, experiencing significant radiation exposure

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,000
due to the van Allen belts.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,180
There was a threat, that they would just shut them off..

28
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,500
Okay, who do we have to talk to, to make sure they keep these satellites alive?

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,260
They had an idea, for how to use them to make the best tests of general relativity to date;

30
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,300
This was a strike of luck for us, we had been proposing such missions.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,580
When we saw that this accident happened, we were very happy about it, of course.

32
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,200
Now, the satellites did have propellant on board,

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,160
intended to allow for periodic course corrections over their planned 10 year lifespan.

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,660
 

35
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,700
And they could use that fuel to attempt to correct their orbits.

36
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,260
So they used the propellant on board -

37
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:15,855
They did some of these maneuvers to bring them into stable orbit -

38
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,940
But they didn't have enough to completely turn their elliptical orbits into circular ones.

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,840
They couldn't circularize completely, thankfully for our project.

40
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,640
According to general relativity, relative to a reference clock, clocks tick slower in stronger gravitational fields.

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,580
That is to say, closer to large masses, like the Earth, deeper in gravitational wells,

42
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,080
 

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,080
so, clocks in satellites should tick faster relative to those on Earth,

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,920
because they're in weaker gravitational fields

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,420
 

46
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,660
Here, I'm ignoring the special relativistic effect that works the other way -

47
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,720
making clocks in satellites tick slower than those on Earth,

48
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,940
because they're moving so much faster.

49
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,060
This velocity effect is very well tested, so we focused on the gravitational parts.

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,320
The gravitational effect is hard to measure precisely, for satellites in circular orbit,

51
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,660
but satellites in elliptical orbit, have an advantage - -

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,820
In every orbit -

53
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,680
they go from their lowest position - perigee,

54
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:12,585
to the highest position - apogee, and back.

55
00:03:12,585 --> 00:03:15,325
If you want to test the gravitational red-shift of a clock, you need two things - -

56
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:20,020
you need a very accurate clock, and you need a large change in gravitational potential.

57
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:26,380
The satellite goes from 17000 to 26000 kilometers.

58
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,440
The difference in altitude is almost 9000 (!!!) kilometers,

59
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,580
meaning they are rapidly, and repeatedly going from lower gravitational potential,

60
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,760
to higher gravitational potential, and back.

61
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,600
So clocks on board, should be ticking slower when they're closer to the Earth,

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,140
and then faster when they go to their high point,

63
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,200
and they'll keep oscillating back and forth; slower and faster relative to clocks on Earth.

64
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:48,980
 

65
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,000
If you compare a clock on the ground, and a clock on the satellite,

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,620
then you will have this variation of time..

67
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,560
Now, what's great about this, is it allows you to eliminate a lot of sources of error -

68
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,900
because, you don't really care about the absolute accuracy of the clocks;

69
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,980
All you want to know, is the difference between the rate of ticking

70
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,660
at the low point compared to the high point.

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,000
And since it's the same clock making the measurements at both locations,

72
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,100
you can eliminate a lot of errors, like the noise in the clock, or a systematic drift,

73
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,680
and that's what allows the scientists to achieve such incredible precision.

74
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,080
Why we could do it - is because it's a very predictable effect.

75
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,960
Due to the eccentricity of the orbit - the signal we were looking for, is really the modulation.

76
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:39,220
All the other effects - that are at other periods - they will not have an influence on your measurements.

77
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,640
Now, I should point out, that if you were traveling with the satellite,

78
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,500
for you - time would not speed up and slow down; time would be passing at a constant rate.

79
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,380
You wouldn't be able to measure any change in the rate the clock is ticking.

80
00:04:52,380 --> 00:05:02,080
The relativity comes when you compare two clocks which are distant enough to feel the curvature of space and time.

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,800
The clocks on the satellites - there are a couple of different types - are all atomic clocks.

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,740
The primary clock typically is a passive hydrogen MASER clock.

83
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,000
A MASER - is just like a laser, except it uses microwaves.

84
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,920
Atoms of hydrogen interact with one specific frequency of microwaves -

85
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,800
A photon of precisely this frequency, will flip the spin of an electron.

86
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,460
 

87
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,360
So by tuning the microwaves, so that they best interact with the hydrogen atoms,

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,160
and then counting up exactly this number of cycles of that radiation,

89
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:39,240
that's one second. You can keep track of time with incredible stability.

90
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,500
In fact, over a 30 million years, a clock like this -

91
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,900
would not be out by more than a second.

92
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,400
 

93
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,860
Again, if you were traveling with the satellite, you would always observe the frequency of this radiation to be

94
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,920
the same. But, if you sent this radiation out - -

95
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,425
 

96
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:57,125
to a distant observer -

97
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,460
who is not in a strong gravitational field,

98
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,540
they would observe the frequency of your microwaves to be slightly lower than those from their hydrogen maser.

99
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,720
In other words - red-shifted.

100
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,360
And the closer the satellite is to Earth, the more red-shifted the microwaves would appear.

101
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,820
And hence the slower time would pass, relative to that distant  observer.

102
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,280
Locally, you can not see any relativistic effect

103
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,780
This is called the equivalence principle.

104
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,540
It's only when you compare the satellite clock to one on Earth,

105
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,880
that you would find the yo-yo-ing rate of the satellite's clock due to it's oscillation back and forth

106
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
in Earth's gravitational well.

107
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:40,900
This gravitational redshift was previously measured most precisely in 1976.

108
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,520
That's right, for over 40 years, we haven't improved our measurement of the gravitational effect on time.

109
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,800
In 1976, Gravity Probe A was launched aboard a sub-orbital rocket -

110
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,020
it went up in a parabolic trajectory, reaching a maximum altitude of 10000 kilometers,

111
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,500
and then it came down

112
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,600
That gives you quite a lot of modulation

113
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,800
and gravitational potential.

114
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,280
The whole time it was in contact with the Earth, through the microwave signal of the on-board hydrogen maser.

115
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,140
And then they did a direct frequency comparison, so they really did a two-way microwave link.

116
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,980
This allowed for a direct comparison of the rate of which a clock would tick on a rocket,

117
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,920
relative to a clock on Earth.

118
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,120
The results matched the predictions of general relativity down to a 140 parts per million.

119
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,580
The scientists I'm talking to were eventually able to convince those in charge of the satellites,

120
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,820
to let them use their misfortune to test the gravitational redshift predictions of general relativity.

121
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:41,640
But actually carrying out the tests, wasn't easy; one of the biggest sources of error was the positions of the satellites.

122
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,560
You'd think, in the emptiness of space, the satellites would perfectly

123
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,760
maintain their orbits.

124
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,100
But that neglects the power of sunlight.

125
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:57,840
The photons of the sun, bouncing on the satellites, is the biggest source of error.

126
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,660
That's right, the momentum of photons hitting the satellites was enough to significantly impact

127
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,280
the measurements. Careful modeling plus laser ranging to the satellites, brought the orbital uncertainties

128
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,420
down to an acceptable level.

129
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,800
One way to improve the statistics was by collecting data over more than a thousand days.

130
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,655
That's almost 3 years

131
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:19,355
Unlike Gravity Probe A, which spent only

132
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:20,395
2 hours in space

133
00:08:20,395 --> 00:08:21,535
So .. what did they find?

134
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:27,585
I think that we both agree that we did not prove Relativity

135
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:31,065
There isn't that we confirm the General Relativity

136
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:32,305
Unfortunately

137
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:36,615
They were able to reduce the uncertainty in the measurement

138
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,115
by a factor of 5

139
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:41,865
over Gravity Probe A
So it's a new high score

140
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:44,915
the first in over 40 years

141
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:47,585
But what is the point?
You saying 'unfortunately'

142
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,125
Yeah

143
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,395
You know what we're looking for, is deviation from

144
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:55,405
General Relativity. Because we know

145
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:58,105
this is not the ultimate error.

146
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,155
History has taught us that, new physics always lies at the boundaries.

147
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:04,175
that more and more precise tests sometimes

148
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:07,285
reveal brand new aspects of nature, that we never would've observed

149
00:09:07,565 --> 00:09:10,485
if we had not made efforts to look

150
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:13,935
and there are good reasons to believe that General Relativity may not be the whole story

151
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:16,955
Both it and Quantum Mechanics are spectacularly

152
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:19,795
successful theories in their own rights

153
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:22,885
But for nearly a century, all attempts to merge the two

154
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:25,845
have been more or less failures. Plus

155
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:26,845
our current

156
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,015
world view includes dark energy and dark matter which make up more than 90% of

157
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:33,045
everything there is in the universe.
The fact that this is all down

158
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:35,975
is not understood, tells me that maybe, we don't know

159
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,005
everything about gravity already.
When more tests are planned

160
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:42,035
to further prove the General Relativity and determine if there's a test it can pass

161
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:46,025
a cold cesium atom clock is set to fly in the international

162
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:48,955
space station and it aims to reduce the deviation

163
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,785
by a further factor of 10.
As for the satellites,

164
00:09:51,785 --> 00:09:54,685
their orbits were made more circular using the propellants on board

165
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:57,575
though they are still elliptical.
The navigation signals have

166
00:09:57,575 --> 00:10:00,615
been tested and are within acceptable parameters.

167
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:03,365
For the moment, they are restricted to 'test mode'

168
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:06,495
awaiting some new software and modifications on the ground, but

169
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:09,505
the hope is that they will be useful for navigation after all

170
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:12,345
and in the meantime, they hold the record for achieving

171
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,705
the best test yet of General Relativity

172
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:17,345
 

173
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:21,595

'Atomic Habits' by James Clear.
We are

181
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:44,425
approaching that time of year when everyone makes new year's resolutions

182
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:47,055
and wants to change some big things

183
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:50,515
about their lives. But what this books recommends, is actually making

184
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:53,075
tiny changes consistently is

185
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:56,095
the best way to achieve the long term changes that you

186
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,080
wanna see in your life and I have found this book already, just a few chapters in

00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,920
