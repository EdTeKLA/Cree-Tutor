1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:10,900
these are shade balls they're being dumped into this water reservoir in Los Angeles

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,900
and contrary to what you may have heard their main purpose is not to reduce evaporation

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:26,100
so what are they really for? To find out I am visiting the largest collection of these balls anywhere on Earth at L.A. reservoir

4
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:41,520
96 million shade balls. That's correct. 96 million it's very rare for you to see 96 million of anything

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,800
This is your life vest which you are required to wear. Alright.

6
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,940
Throw your leg over and climb on in anyway you can

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,800
there you go. Thank you

8
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:00,940
looking at this I had so many questions. Like why are they black? Are they safe to have in drinking water?

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:08,100
How much do they cost? Do they actually reduce evaporation? And what is their real purpose?

10
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,300
is it hard to drive in shade balls. It is very hard. Why is that?

11
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:26,900
These are actually partially filled with water the reason they're filled with water is that in L.A reservoir we have some really high winds

12
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:33,560
and so if we didn't put water in these things there'd be balls bouncing on the 5 freeways people would drive down they'd be all over the place

13
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,260
so these keep the balls in the reservoir and if they do start to roll they kinda wobble because of water makes them uneven

14
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:48,180
but that makes them significantly difficult to push out of the way especially when they form close-packed crystal like structures

15
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,500
behind the boat the balls quickly come together in our wake

16
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,440
and some close to the motor are pulled along with boat

17
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,400
wow

18
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,220
did you what did you think the first time they suggested doing this or when it first came in

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,500
yeah it was a little out there. did you think they were nuts? No, not nuts

20
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
it just like. It looks absurd

21
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,980
It's like we're in the world's biggest ball pit

22
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,940
yeah right that's what it looks like you can't tell by standing here that we're actually floating over

23
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:37,180
I think it's probably 40 50 feet right here, 40 50 feet deep below us

24
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,180
and you can't even see any water

25
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,040
you'd think it was a joke. Right?

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,700
if you didn't know. You'd would be like no you're not that's like a green screen or something alright yeah it's fake

27
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,000
so like when i switch on my tap at home is the water coming from here?

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,260
Yes. Sometimes, or always. Most of the times

29
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,160
Most of the time the water is coming from here, absolutely nuts

30
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,060
so why is LA reservoir covered in shade balls?

31
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,700
the problem all started with Bromide

32
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,920
Bromide is a naturally occurring substance associated with salt water

33
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,780
and so normally places like  the California aqueduct that comes down from the delta

34
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,100
you get some salt water intrusions we have some bromide in the water

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,340
bromide is harmless and it's almost impossible to remove

36
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,680
and when you disinfect the water with ozone, that bromide becomes bromate

37
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,680
and bromates are carcinogenic

38
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,020
and so around year 2000 they wrote regulations regulating bromate

39
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,060
and the regulations basically said if you have a treatment plant that uses ozone

40
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,980
then you have to watch bromate to be careful not to form to much

41
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,200
so the only place we ever measured bromate was in our filter plant

42
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,140
and the results were always within 10 micrograms per liter limit set by regulators

43
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,100
so they were confused when they got a call from one of their customers a beverage company in L.A

44
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,100
they said we have some really high levels of bromate showing up are you aware of this?

45
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,860
and we said well we don't show anything

46
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,160
but between the filtration plant and the customer was the reservoir

47
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,220
so they did some tests

48
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,460
almost immediatly upon coming into this open reservoir the bromate levels jumped

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
it turned that bromide with chlorine which is supposed to be safe in bright sunlight form bromate even more than ozone

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,200
and so we made this unfortunate scientific discovery that actually wasn't a part of any regulatory scheme

51
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
and so here we are at reservoir

52
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,100
we have water source that's got bromide in it harmless

53
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,020
we have chlorine, we have to have disinfected water, we have sunlight because it is open

54
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,300
the only choice we have is to remove sunlight

55
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,380
so we looked at all sorts of things

56
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,720
we looked at floating tarps across the water

57
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,600
and normally we put a floating cover on the water but that's a multi-year project

58
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,100
and so we said can't we manufacture kind of trampoline with poly like PVC pipe

59
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,900
they're just gonna become bird perches, it'll have a big water quality problem

60
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,240
and so we knew we had high density polyethylene pipe which is used in the water industry

61
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,460
and we know that it floats and we at one point thought about can we get to float a pile of pipe across the surface

62
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,240
well that's hard to do and very expensive because it's a lot of material

63
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,480
so maybe we could take some pipe and run it through a chipper and we can make a debris field across the surface

64
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,800
like the back corner of a lake somewhere

65
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,500
but in anyhow all this mushy warm water with plastic floating on the top that sounds like a petri dish

66
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,000
and so lo and behold Dr Brian White did some research and he found the shade ball

67
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,380
except they weren't called shade balls at the time

68
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,860
this product existed and they were called bird balls

69
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,260
and they'd use it on ponds that had mine tailings where they didn't want waterfowl to go in and get poisoned

70
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,460
and also around airports where there were ponds and they wanted to keep the waterfowl off so that they didn't take off and get into the jet engines
