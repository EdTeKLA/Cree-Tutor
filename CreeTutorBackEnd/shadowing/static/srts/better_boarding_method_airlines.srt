1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,985
The Lord of the Rings has lots of 
different kinds of people:

2
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:06,809
Elven people, dwarvin people, tree people,
half-sized people, even people people.

3
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:09,633
There's, like, a million pages  of
background explaining this world

4
00:00:09,657 --> 00:00:11,757
that goes much deeper than the books
or the movies

5
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:13,181
but if you don't want to read 
it all,

6
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:14,805
here's a four-minute summary.

7
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:15,729
Starting with wizards.

8
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:18,553
It's easy to mistake the wizards
as humans trained in magic,

9
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:19,477
like elsewhere.

10
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:22,901
But, in The Lord of the Rings, wizards
are low-ish level angels.

11
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:25,625
They're called The Istari
(get ready for lots of names in this video)

12
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:28,649
and there are ﬁve of them:
Sauroman the white, Gandalf the gray,

13
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:30,673
Radgast the brown, and the two
Blue Wizards.

14
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:35,297
Their power comes mostly from being
supernatural and not so much from book

15
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:35,621
learning.

16
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:38,745
Their sent(by who? We'll get to that in a
second) to help the people of

17
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:40,169
world stand against evil.

18
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:42,193
Not wildly successfully, either.

19
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:45,017
Sauroman, the leader of the ﬁve,
with a mind of metal and wheels

20
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,741
gets corrupted, Radgast gets distracted
by all the pretty nature, the Blue Wizards

21
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:52,165
just kind of fade into the east,
possibly starting cults of magic,

22
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:54,689
and it's only Gandalf that stays
true to the quest.

23
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:57,813
Now, where there's angels, there's a
god, and in this universe,

24
00:00:57,837 --> 00:00:59,037
that's Eru Ilúvatar.

25
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:02,661
In the beginning, there was not but Eru,
and the infinite timeless nothing,

26
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:06,385
which is rather boring, so he created
lots of angels to keep him company.

27
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,709
Ilúvatar's angels are called The Ainur
and are divided into two groups:

28
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:12,333
The Valar, guardians of the world,
of which there are fourteen.

29
00:01:12,357 --> 00:01:14,157
(or ﬁfteen, depending on who you
want to count)

30
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:15,181
And their servants, The Mayar.

31
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:18,305
So, the wizards are the Istari, a
subset of the Mayar, which serve the

32
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,329
Valar, all created by Ilúvatar.

33
00:01:20,353 --> 00:01:23,653
Ilúvatar, and all his angels sang
together to make the world.

34
00:01:23,677 --> 00:01:26,877
The harmony started out great, but
there was one Valar, named Melkor,

35
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:30,501
and just from the name, Melkor,
you know what's going to happen

36
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:33,925
even before learning he's also the
smartest, and the most powerful

37
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:34,649
of the angels.

38
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:35,973
And also a bit of a loner.

39
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:38,897
Melkor didn't want just to be part of
the chorus, like his dimmer Valar

40
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:39,421
co-workers,

41
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:41,545
he wanted his own song in creations.

42
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:44,069
And so, his voice became discordant
from the others...

43
00:01:44,093 --> 00:01:46,493
and created all the suffering and evil
in the world.

44
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:49,317
But, Melkor's song also attracted some
Maylar to his side,

45
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:53,041
including the balrogs, which means the
balrog is a low-level angel,

46
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:56,565
making him on the same level
of the power org chart as Gandalf.

47
00:01:56,589 --> 00:02:00,489
Which explains why an old man can
hold his ground against a giant lava

48
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:00,913
monster.

49
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:03,837
Through his discordant singing,
Melkor also created some of the evil

50
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:06,261
creatures in the world, such as the
dragons and trolls, which

51
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:08,285
ﬁnally gets us to things that aren't
angels.

52
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:12,409
Other valar also made their own
non-angelic creations, though in a more

53
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,833
cooperative spirit with Ilúvatar.

54
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:16,357
Manwë makes the Great Eagles,
Aulë made the dwarves,

55
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:20,281
and his wife, Yavanna made all of the
animals and the plants in the world,

56
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:23,505
before capping off that minor task with
The Ents, her own

57
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:24,829
race of sentient creatures.

58
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,953
While Ilúvatar seemed happy
to leave it to his Vala

59
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:29,577
to make *most* of the stuff,
he did personally create

60
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:30,801
men and elves,

61
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:33,825
which makes them special,
and kind of above all the other living

62
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:34,249
creatures.

63
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:35,373
Sorry, Dwarves.

64
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:39,297
And, of these two, the men
are Ilúvatar's favorite children.

65
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:43,021
And, he shows this by giving men
shorter lives than everybody else,

66
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:45,045
and also the gift of death?

67
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,269
Thanks a lot, Dad.

68
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:48,893
But, their short live set them apart
from the other creatures, and they

69
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:52,517
aren't tied to the music of creation
and the world, like everyone else.

70
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,041
And so, are able to forge their own
futures.

71
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:58,665
These qualities make them the
"Get Stuff Done" species of Middle Earth.

72
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:02,089
Elves, on the other hand, are so
connected to the world that practically

73
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:05,113
made of nature. Same with the dwarves
in their own way

74
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:06,137
and the Ents, of course.

75
00:03:07,161 --> 00:03:10,061
These species all but follow the flow
of nature, and it's partly why the

76
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:13,385
humans have such a hard time getting
them to do anything.

77
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:16,809
Even when faced with armies of Orcs,
which brings us to Orcs.

78
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:20,533
Melkor was powerful, but couldn't make
his creatures as great as the elves and

79
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:23,357
men, and so cheated by corrupting some
of them in the beginning and

80
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:26,881
selectively breading them over the
generations into these creatures.

81
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:30,305
This business Melkor was up to of
torturing elves, making monsters,

82
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:34,129
recuiting angels from the other side
eventually, but unsurprisingly, led to

83
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:37,453
a war that Melkor looses and got him
banished into the void.

84
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:40,477
All of the conflict in
The Lord of The Rings comes long after the

85
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:43,501
epic Good vs. Evil fight of
that universe.

86
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:46,325
Sauron, the Big Bad, who caused all of
the trouble in these books,

87
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:49,349
was just one of the Mayar, though
an unusually powerful one

88
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:52,073
who started his career as Melkor's
lieutenant.

89
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:55,197
After the war, he did make a ring to
focus his strength, but that's a

90
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:56,721
story for another time.

91
00:03:56,745 --> 00:03:59,045
Last, but not least, we have the Hobbits.

92
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,869
Even though they seem related to Dwarves,
what with the living underground and the

93
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:04,393
vertical challenge, Hobbits are a
subspecies of men.

94
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:07,617
For such an important and pivotal race,
there is little written of their origin,

95
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:09,441
other than the phrase "related to men".

96
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:12,765
Turns out, with a million pages,
you still can't talk about everything,

97
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:14,789
just like in a four-minute video.
